# Ex 3
The routing table does not have any static route. Maybe because the tunnel interface doesn't have an IP address.

# Ex 4
Now the static route appears on the routing table.
The packets are encapsulated in another IP header (Router1 and Router3 tunnel endpoints IPs) and the inside header has source tunnel IP address and ping destination address.

# Ex 5
Now the internal IPs are the ones from the Router interfaces
